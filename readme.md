## GameScout

Keeps track of video game prices across multiple stores, and alerts user to sales/discounts.

Currently uses the Steam Storefront API as the groundwork for looking up games, and uses the information from there to fetch prices from other stores.
Unofficial documentation for Steam API from: https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI

To implement:
- <s>Steam Store</s>
- Epic Games Store
- GOG Store
